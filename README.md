# Twitter US Airline Sentiment Analysis

Air travel is a huge business in the US. Since Air travel is a service industry Airlines will want
to know how they can improve or what they need to do better from their customers. People are
always talking about their air travel stories to each other being good or bad. With twitter people can
and will tag the airline in their response to their travel. From twitter data the airlines can see what
features are causing positive or negative tweets. And from the data decide what to do as a company.

This project will be focusing on building a model that will analyze the text of a tweet. There
are three sentiment classes that a tweet can be marked as in this data: negative, neutral, and
positive. The goal of the model is to predict, from the text, what sentiment class the tweet is. Once
the unknown tweets are classified the airlines can determine how to improve or see what they are
doing right.
